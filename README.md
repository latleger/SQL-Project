# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals

Is there a relationship between revenues and various cities/countries? Is there a relationship between stock and order levels? Is there a relationship between time on site and purchases? 
	

## Process

1. Review and understand data
	- I started comparing column information from the various tables
	- I reviewed data types, to see if they make sense.
	- I reviewed project questions to ensure I focused on cleaning important informaiton first.
	
2. Clean and transform Data 
	- I looked for NULL values and decided if they should be removed or converted.
	- I found duplicate values and decided if they should be removed.
	- I checked if columns were formated with correct data types.
	- I formated data within columns, ie. prices had two decimal points, cities and countries has proper capitalization, 	etc. 

3. Develop insights
	- Because there was so much information, I focused on the questions required. 
	- From there I grouped relevant information together into a smaller table and cleaned the data.
	- Once I cleaned the data, I started to see more relevant information when I continued to clean additional data.
	
4. QA Process
	- check to ensure NULL values have been taken care of by reviewing tables/columns
	- ensure duplicates have been removed to ensure incorrect analysis

## Results
	- Custoemrs are primarily within the United States.
	- Custoemr are mostly purchasing NEST Smarthome products.
	- Product stock levels are dependant on lead times or quantities sold.

## Challenges 
	- This database has a lot of NULL values.
	- Ensuring data was reviewed carefully and data types are assigned correctly.
	- Trying to understand the connection between tables was very difficult.
	- However, I was able to focus on smaller portions of the database to get a better understanding of the data.

## Future Goals
	- If I had more time and someone who could help me with relevance of some of the data, I woudld have had a better 	understanding and been able to tackle the infomation in a more logical manner.
